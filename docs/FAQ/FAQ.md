# FAQ

1.What's Data Availability(DA)?

DA not only includes data storage, but also needs to ensure that any node can access the data. After Layer 2 Rollup, the Ethereum expansion solution, executes transactions and submits transactions, the verification node needs to verify the transaction data, and only the transactions that pass verification will be finalized by Layer 1. The premise of the verification process is to be able to access transaction data. Therefore, transaction data can be accessed by any node, thereby facilitating the process of verifying the correctness of transactions is called data availability.
