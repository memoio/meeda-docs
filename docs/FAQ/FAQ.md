# FAQ

1.What's Data Availability(DA)?

DA originally meant the accessibility of stored data, but in Ethereum, DA has a specific meaning. After Layer 2 of the Ethereum expansion plan executes a transaction and submits the transaction, the verification node needs to verify the transaction data, and only the transaction that passes the verification will be finalized by Layer 1. The premise of the verification process is to be able to access the transaction data. Therefore, the transaction data can be accessed by any node, thereby facilitating the process of verifying the correctness of the transaction. It is called Ethereumâ€™s [Data Availability(DA)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-availability/).
