# What's Meeda

[Memolabs](https://memolabs.org/) has launched an efficient and simple Ethereum DA solution, which provides reliable data availability guarantee for execution layers such as Layer2 Rollup. Different levels of availability guarantees are provided based on different cost options.

&nbsp;

This solution is named Meeda, which extracts the letters from MEMO, Ethereum, and data availability, and is linked with the Bitcoin data availability solution Mooda launched by Memolabs. The first two letters together form MEMO (the underlying decentralized cloud storage system launched by Memolabs).

## DA Problem

For blockchain, data availability (DA) is a very important thing. As we all know, consensus is an important part of the blockchain, and if nodes want to reach consensus, they must ensure reliable data availability. Nodes can access the transaction data of the current block to verify whether the transaction is correct, thereby preventing malicious transactions from being uploaded to the chain, maintaining the correct "accounting" record of the blockchain, and ensuring the security and reliability of the blockchain.

&nbsp;

However, in an overall blockchain like Ethereum, DA is usually used as part of a single system design. When the block space is limited and the block space utilization is high, the gas fee will become higher and higher, and the cost of a single transaction will become higher and higher. The higher the value, the worse the user experience will be and the development of Web3 will be restricted.

&nbsp;

Ethereum has also become aware of the expansion problem in recent years and has begun to explore various off-chain expansion solutions. Currently, Rollups have become a popular solution. However, when the Web3 ecosystem is prosperous and the demand for block space is high, it still facing the problem of excessive gas fees.

## Current DA Solutions

Based on this current situation, there are currently two main solutions. The first is to optimize the storage overhead of Layer 2, such as Ethereumâ€™s Danksharding proposal, which currently uses EIP-4844 to implement blob transactions and reduce the storage overhead of Layer 2 when relying on Ethereum as the data availability layer; the second is modular blockchain solutions, design the execution layer, consensus layer, and data availability layer separately, such as the Celestia project, which aims to simplify blockchain deployment by providing a pluggable consensus network.

## Meeda Solution

### Meeda Overview

Currently, Layer 2, as an expansion solution for Ethereum, can safely and reliably expand Layer 1, improve throughput and reduce transaction fees. But there is still a problem: it cannot reduce data synchronization overhead and storage overhead. The original transaction data still needs to be submitted to the L1 chain, and the full nodes on L1 still need to synchronize these transaction data. Even though there are some other solutions, such as ERC-4337 to compress some transaction data, and EIP-4844 introducing the `blob` transaction type, the effect is still limited. The most intuitive manifestation is that storing these transaction data on the L1 chain still requires high gas fees, although these fees are byte fees rather than execution fees.

&nbsp;

The fundamental reason is that Layer2 regards the Ethereum L1 chain as its own DA layer (Data Availability). Meeda stores data off-chain, and stores the index used to obtain the data and the proof of commitment to ensure data reliability on-chain. While ensuring data availability, it also reduces synchronization overhead and storage overhead on the chain, maximizing the expansion of the blockchain. Ensuring data security relies on the corresponding challenge and verification mechanism of the Meeda layer. Therefore, Meeda's access is also very simple and efficient, and can be compatible with any Layer 2 chain.

Meeda can be used as a data availability solution for Layer 2, providing low-cost, highly scalable data availability guarantee for Layer 2, and forming a reliable triangular relationship with blockchains such as Ethereum. You can also cooperate with modular solutions to participate in modular blockchains as a data availability layer, providing developers and users with a simpler and more convenient way to build and use Web3.

&nbsp;

Off-chain, nodes that issue transactions upload transaction information to Meeda. Meeda ensures the availability of transaction information, and nodes can quickly and easily read transaction data. On the chain, Meeda needs to regularly submit data availability certificates to the chain. If the certificate is passed, it can be considered that the availability of user data is guaranteed. If the certificate fails, data repair will be triggered. Among them, the verification method of file availability proof is efficient and low-cost. It adopts optimistic multi-round interactive verification method, KZG polynomial commitment and other technologies to achieve this feature; Meeda conducts availability spot checks on transaction data, and configures erasure codes and multiple backups flexibly. scheme, thus greatly improving data availability.

### Meeda Architecture

Meeda's own logic is divided into two parts: off-chain and on-chain. The off-chain part is called the storage layer, and the on-chain part is called the DA layer. By storing the data off-chain, and storing the index used to obtain the data and the proof of commitment to ensure data reliability on the chain, it not only ensures data availability, but also reduces the synchronization overhead and storage on the chain. Overhead, maximally scaling the blockchain.

&nbsp;

Specifically, the off-chain part is responsible for storing transaction data, providing data reading functions, responding to data availability proof challenges, and performing data repair. The on-chain part is responsible for ensuring data availability. It mainly records the commitment value and metadata information of transaction data, generates storage challenge information, records the data availability certificate submitted under the chain, responds to the availability fraud certificate, and incentivizes data repair.
