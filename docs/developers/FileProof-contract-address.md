Notice:

The contract is currently deployed on the Memo-dev chain.

The contract code is located in `DID-Solidity/tree/memoda/contracts` in gitlab (not yet public), and the contract go code converted by `abigen` is located in `DID-Solidity/tree/memoda/go-contracts`.

The user constructs a `FileProofProxy` contract instance through the `FileProofProxy` contract address and directly calls the `FileProofProxy` contract instance to interact with the `FileProof` contract.
