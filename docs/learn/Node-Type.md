# Meeda's Node Type

There are three types of nodes: Storage Node, Light Node, and Operator.

Storage Node is the node that stores blob data and continuously generates proof of commitment of data availability. Deployment of Storage Node is open to all users.

Light Node challenges on-chain verification. Deployment of Light Node is open to all users.

Operator performs redundant encoding and segmentation of data, and aggregates commitment proof. Operator is currently deployed by the project side.
